The Makefile in this directory works under linux and Windows (with cygwin).
Note that under Windows, dependencies are broken, necessitating a
"make clean" to force rebuilds after changing header files.  See the note
in the Makefile just before the "-include $(DEPS)" line for explanation. 
The prerequisites are:

1. The avr32-gnu toolchain.  For linux this is assumed to be located in
~/avrtools/avr32-gnu-toolchain-linux_x86_64/; for Windows it is assumed to
be in c:\Program Files (x86)\Atmel\AVR Tools\AVR Toolchain.  The location
can be overridden with the variable AVR32_TOOLCHAIN_DIR.  The linux version
of the toolchain is available for download at
http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelavrtoolchainforlinux.aspx.  There is also
a copy of the archive for linux_x86_64 in the google drive for
allan@hashfast.com under "Atmel Tools".

2. The avr headers.  These are assumed to be located in
~/avrtools/atmel-headers-6.1.3.1475.  The location can be overridden with
the variable AVR32_HEADERS_DIR.  The headers are available for download
at http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelavrtoolchainforlinux.aspx.  There is
also a copy of the archive in the google drive for allan@hashfast.com
under "Atmel Tools".

3. atprogram, for programming the loader into a part using jtag.  At this
time, atprogram is only available for Windows.  It is assumed to be in
c:\Program Files (x86)\Atmel\Atmel Studio 6.1\atbackend.

The makefile has three main targets.  The default, "all", builds all; the
final output is uc3_loader.hex.  "program" programs the image into flash
using jtag (as noted above, this target only works under Windows).  "clean"
removes all of the generated files.
