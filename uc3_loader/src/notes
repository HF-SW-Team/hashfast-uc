In the Sierra chassis, one of the modules does not have standby power.  When
a module reboots to switch modes, main power controlled by that module is
temporarily turned off. That could cause modules to do a power on reset,
losing the state information that would have told them to stay in loader
mode.  Tests so far have shown that they power is not in fact dropping fast
enough for this to occur but we don't want to rely on that.  This version
of the loader adds the capability of rebooting only the slaves into loader
mode, as well as rebooting individual modules into loader mode.  This
provides all the tools necessary for a host tool to manage to get everything
setup for an update no matter what state they start in and whatever the
power wiring is (assuming it's a configuration that can be used at all).
Updates can be done today with the existing hfupdate operated by someone who
understands these states.  A smart host tool to do this automatically is left
as as exercise to the reader at this time since it is not necessary before
the first field updates are sent out.
